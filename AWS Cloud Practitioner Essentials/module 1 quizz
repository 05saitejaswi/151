1)what is cloud computing?
The correct response option is On-demand delivery of IT resources and applications through the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing.
The other response options are incorrect because:

It is possible to back up files to the cloud, but this response option does not describe cloud computing as a whole.
Deploying applications connected to on-premises infrastructure is a sample use case for a hybrid cloud deployment. Remember that cloud computing also has cloud and on-premises (or private cloud) deployment models.
AWS Lambda is an AWS service that lets you run code without needing to manage or provision servers. This description does not describe cloud computing as a whole. AWS Lambda is explained in greater detail later in the course.


2)What is another name for on-premises deployment?
The correct response option is Private cloud deployment.
The other response options are incorrect because:

Cloud-based applications are fully deployed in the cloud and do not have any parts that run on premises.
A hybrid deployment connects infrastructure and applications between cloud-based resources and existing resources that are not in the cloud, such as on-premises resources. However, a hybrid deployment is not equivalent to an on-premises deployment because it involves resources that are located in the cloud.
The AWS Cloud offers three cloud deployment models: cloud, hybrid, and on-premises. This response option is incorrect because the AWS Cloud is not equivalent to only an on-premises deployment.

3)How does the scale of cloud computing help you to save costs?
The correct response option is The aggregated cloud usage from a large number of customers results in lower pay-as-you-go prices.
This answer describes how customers can benefit from massive economies of scale in cloud computing.
The other response options are incorrect because:

Not having to invest in technology resources before using them relates to Trade upfront expense for variable expense.
Accessing services on-demand to prevent excess or limited capacity relates to Stop guessing capacity.
Quickly deploying applications to customers and providing them with low latency relates to Go global in minutes.
