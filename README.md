Public Cloud	                                   Public CloudCloud computing resources shared amongst multiple customers, with applications and data still separate.


Private Cloud	                                   Private Cloud Cloud computing resources that are dedicated to only one entity. This is most similar to how on-premises resources                                                    operate, but with the resources still hosted off-site by a third party.


Hybrid Cloud	                                   Hybrid Cloud Utilizing a mix of public and private cloud resources.


Cloud Developer                                	Developers who build cloud applications or utilize other cloud resources in their applications. They are responsible for ensuring                                                 applications run efficiently in the cloud, requiring appropriate authentication to access, and identifying appropriate      
                                                resources to use.

Microsoft Azure	                                A public computing platform provided by Microsoft, with many products spanning many categories, such as Compute, Analytics,                                                         Databases, A.I. and Machine Learning.

Azure Portal                                  	The browser-based and GUI version of working with Azure resources.

Elasticity	                                    The ability to scale up or down resources to match demand.

On-Premises                                    	The non-cloud option where companies host all their necessary compute, storage and other resources on-site.

Infrastructure as a Service (Iaas)	             Removes the expense of up-front costs of hardware, software and test environments, as the cloud provider is instead responsible                                                   for providing physical hardware.

Platform as a Service (Paas)	                 Handles networking, provides middleware and development & database tools, in addition to the physical hardware provided at the                                                    IaaS  level.

Software as a Service (Saas)	               Provides end-users access to online cloud solutions, without the need to build or support the underlying applications themselves.
